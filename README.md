# 👋 Hi, I'm Arya Patel

🎯 **Network Engineer | CCNA Certified | Tech Problem Solver**
💡 Passionate about building secure, scalable, and automated networks using real-world technologies and hands-on labs.

I’m a **CCNA-certified network engineer** with over **2 years of experience** in enterprise environments — designing and supporting robust network infrastructures for high-impact clients like **Adani, NIXI, Amazon, and HDFC**. I specialize in **Layer 2/3 switching**, **dynamic routing protocols**, and **network automation using Python and Ansible**.

I use this GitHub space to document my projects, labs, and learnings in public — to grow, help others, and stay aligned with industry standards.
